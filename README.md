## Features

* **Automatic Map Updates:** the biggest inconvenience with most weather radar
  visualisations is out-of-date data. Meteocool notifies its clients as
  soon as new radar data becomes available and the client tries
  to be transparent about the dataset age. Say goodbye to hammering F5!
* **Live Lightning Strikes:** new lightning strikes are displayed instantly,
  giving you an even better feeling for the cloud formation's intensity,
  trajectory and speed.
* **Push Notifications:** get notified about incoming rain up to 60 minutes
  in advance. Works in any modern browser and on iOS.
* **Dark Mode:** great for HUD-like displays and general night time usage.
* **Progressive Web App:** responsive, connectivity independent and app-like.
  Add a shortcut to your iOS or Android Home Screen to use meteocool in
  "app mode".
* **iOS & Android Apps:** native iOS and Android apps provide battery-efficient
  background location services to allow for accurate rain notifications without
  user interaction.
